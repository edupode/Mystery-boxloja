The previous AI engineer initiated work on a React frontend application failing to display products, despite the FastAPI backend functioning correctly. The initial diagnosis involved extensive checks: backend API integrity, frontend console logs, direct API calls, and environment variables. All indicated a functional backend and correct frontend configuration, pointing towards a rendering issue within the React application. The AI then proceeded to refactor the  component in , introducing robust error handling, loading states, and debug information. Upon testing, the user revealed the problem was domain-specific, linked to different deployment branches. The current focus shifted to comparing the code across these branches, specifically trying to access a functional GitHub branch () to identify divergences. The AI is currently attempting to fetch this code for comparison, having faced issues with direct Git commands.

<product_requirements>
The user is working on an e-commerce application named Mystery Box. The core problem is that the frontend, specifically the product display section, is not loading products. Initial diagnostics by the AI engineer confirmed that the FastAPI backend is functioning correctly, returning product data (including images), and direct API calls from the frontend also succeed. This suggested the problem lies within the frontend's rendering logic or connectivity.

Subsequently, it was revealed that the issue is deployment-specific:
1.  The application deployed on  (identified as the  branch or a Vercel deploy) works correctly.
2.  The application deployed on  (identified as the  branch) is not working, showing a Network Error and failing to load products.

The explicit request is to compare the code of the working branch (later identified as  on GitHub: ) with the  branch to pinpoint the exact code differences causing the failure on the  domain. The goal is to resolve the product loading issue on the problematic domain.

-   **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for building backend APIs.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used by the backend.
-   **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Involves Axios for API calls and handling CORS.
-   **Environment Variables**:  (frontend) and  (backend) for configuration.
-   **Git Branching**: Comparison of code between different branches (, , ).

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture:


**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**

-   **/app/backend/**: Contains the FastAPI backend.
    -   : Lists Python dependencies.
    -   : The main FastAPI application file, handling API routes and database interactions. It serves product data, verified to return 11 products.
    -   : Stores backend environment variables, specifically .

-   **/app/frontend/**: Contains the React frontend.
    -   : Node.js dependencies and scripts.
    -   : Tailwind CSS configuration.
    -   : PostCSS configuration.
    -   : Stores frontend environment variables, notably .
    -   : Static assets.
    -   : React source code.
        -   : The application entry point.
        -   : The main React component.
            -   **Summary**: This file contains the  component, which is responsible for fetching and rendering product data from the backend. This file was the primary focus of the AI engineer's modifications.
            -   **Changes Made**: The  component within  was refactored to:
                -   Add  and  states to improve user feedback.
                -   Temporarily remove caching to ensure fresh data fetching.
                -   Include more detailed console logs for debugging.
                -   Display debug information (product and category counts).
                -   Implement better error handling with a retry button.
                -   Add empty state handling when no products are found.
        -   : Component-specific styles.
        -   : Global styles.

<current_work>
The current state of the product involves a functional FastAPI backend successfully serving product data. The React frontend, specifically the  component within , has been significantly refactored. The refactoring included adding comprehensive loading and error states, a retry mechanism, and debug information displays (product/category counts). Caching was temporarily disabled to ensure fresh data. Console logs were enhanced for better traceability of API calls and rendering logic.

Despite these frontend code improvements, the user reported that the website still fails to load products on one specific domain (), while another Vercel deployment () works fine. This shifted the problem's focus from general code functionality to potential differences between deployment branches. The AI engineer attempted to use usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects
